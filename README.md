## Content Planning

### 1. Research Phase
- Identify key topics relevant to the hive mind community
- Gather factual information from credible sources
- Document legal frameworks and regulations if applicable
- Compile real-world examples and case studies
- Interview subject matter experts when possible

### 2. Content Structure
- Create a clear outline with these sections:
  - Attention-grabbing headline
  - Brief introduction to the topic
  - Detailed explanation of key concepts
  - Visual representation of data/concepts
  - Legal or ethical considerations
  - Call to action or next steps
  - Contact information and resources

## Design Guidelines

### 1. Visual Elements
- Use a consistent color scheme (3-4 complementary colors)
- Incorporate the following visual components:
  - Relevant photographs or illustrations
  - Infographics for complex data
  - Icons to represent key concepts
  - QR codes linking to additional resources
  - Organizational logo for branding

### 2. Layout Organization
- Follow a grid-based design structure
- Balance text and visuals (aim for 40% text, 60% visuals)
- Use white space effectively to avoid overcrowding
- Create natural reading flow (typically left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- Group related information visually

## Production Process

### 1. Digital Creation
- Software recommendations:
  - Canva as a source for existing templates

### 2. Physical Production
- Paper selection:
  - Weight: 100-120 gsm for flyers, 170-250 gsm for brochures
  - Finish: Matte or semi-gloss for readability
  - Consider recycled options for sustainability
- Print specifications:
  - CMYK color profile for print materials
  - 300 DPI minimum resolution
  - 3mm bleed for edge-to-edge designs
  - Consider accessibility features (e.g., non-reflective finish)

## Distribution Strategy

### Physical Distribution
- Strategic locations for printed materials:
  - Give to a brainwashed HiveMind member directly
  - Community centers
  - Educational institutions
  - Relevant events and gatherings
